# ecg_classification
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into two categories: Sinus Rhythm and Atrial Fibrillation. The model is trained, validated, and tested using real ECG data, using modern deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and interpretability.
